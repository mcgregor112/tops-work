q - What is DFD?

Answer - A data-flow diagram is a way of representing a flow of data through a process or a system (usually an information system). 
        The DFD also provides information about the outputs and inputs of each entity and the process itself. A data-flow diagram has no
        control flow â€” there are no decision rules and no loops.
