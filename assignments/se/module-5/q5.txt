5. What do you understand by Data Redundancy?

answer - 

Data redundancy refers to the unnecessary duplication of data within a database. Redundant data takes up additional storage space and can lead to 
inconsistencies, as changes in one instance of the data may not be reflected in others. Normalization helps minimize data redundancy by organizing 
data into related tables.
