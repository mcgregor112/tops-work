10. What is a Trigger, and how to create a Trigger in SQL?

answer -

A Trigger is a set of SQL commands that automatically executes (or "fires") in response to specific events on a table, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or 
DELETE. Triggers are often used to enforce business rules, maintain audit trails, or automatically update data.

example - 

CREATE TRIGGER BeforeInsertEmployee
BEFORE INSERT ON Employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    SET NEW.JoinDate = NOW();  -- Automatically set the join date to the current date
END;
