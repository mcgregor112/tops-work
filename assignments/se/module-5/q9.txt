9. What is a Savepoint? How to create a Savepoint? Write a Query.

answer - 

A Savepoint in SQL allows you to set a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back if needed. Savepoints help control transactions 
more granularly by allowing partial rollbacks.

Example:

BEGIN TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO Employees (Name, Position) VALUES ('Alice', 'Manager');
SAVEPOINT Savepoint1;
INSERT INTO Employees (Name, Position) VALUES ('Bob', 'Analyst');
ROLLBACK TO Savepoint1; -- Rollback only the last insert
COMMIT;
