SQL Key Constraints enforce rules about how data is entered into the database to ensure data integrity. Common key constraints include:

PRIMARY KEY: Ensures that each row in a table has a unique identifier.

UNIQUE: Ensures all values in a column are unique.
CHECK: Validates data based on a condition.
NOT NULL: Prevents null values in a column.
