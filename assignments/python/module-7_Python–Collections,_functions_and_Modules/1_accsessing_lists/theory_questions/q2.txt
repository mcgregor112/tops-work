q - Indexing in lists (positive and negative indexing).

Answer :

Positive Indexing: Starts from 0 and increases towards the end of the list.

Negative Indexing: Starts from -1 (the last element) and decreases towards the beginning of the list.

Both positive and negative indexing can be used interchangeably to access elements in a list.
