q - Accessing tuple elements using positive and negative indexing.

Answer :

1. Positive Indexing

Positive indexing starts from 0 for the first element and increases sequentially.

my_tuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange") 
my_tuple[0] accesses the first element ("apple")
my_tuple[1] accesses the second element ("banana")

2. Negative Indexing

Negative indexing starts from -1 for the last element and decreases sequentially.
Example:
my_tuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange") 
my_tuple[-1] accesses the last element ("orange")
