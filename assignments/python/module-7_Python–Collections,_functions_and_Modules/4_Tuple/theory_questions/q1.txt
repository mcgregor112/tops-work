q - Introduction to tuples, immutability.

Answer :

Definition: A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of objects in Python.

Immutability: This means that once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.

Syntax: Tuples are typically defined by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of values within parentheses ().
Example: my_tuple = (1, 2.5, "hello", True)
