q - Defining functions in Python.

Answer :

In Python, a function is a block of code that performs a specific task. It's a reusable unit that can be called multiple times within your program.

Basic Syntax:

def function_name(parameter1, parameter2, ...):
  """Docstring: Briefly explain what the function does."""
  # Code block 
  # ...
  return value
