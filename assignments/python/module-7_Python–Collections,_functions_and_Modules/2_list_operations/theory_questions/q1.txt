q - Common list operations: concatenation, repetition, membership.

Answer :

1 Concatenation :

Concatenation involves combining two or more lists to form a single, larger list. The resulting list contains all the elements from the original lists, in the order they were combined.

2 Repetition :

Repetition involves creating a new list by repeating the elements of an existing list a specified number of times. This effectively multiplies the list's length.

3 Membership :

Membership refers to the ability to check if a particular value exists within a list. This is a fundamental operation for searching and filtering data within a list.
