q - Basic list manipulations: addition, deletion, updating, and slicing.

Answer :

Certainly, let's explore basic list manipulations in Python from a theoretical perspective:

1. Addition

Adding elements to a list.
append(): Adds a single element to the end of the list.
insert(): Adds an element at a specific position within the list.
extend(): Adds all elements from another iterable (like another list) to the end of the list.

2. Deletion

Removing elements from a list.
remove(): Removes the first occurrence of a specific value.
pop(): Removes and returns the element at a specific index (or the last element if no index is provided).
del(): statement: Removes an element at a specific index or a slice of elements.

3. Updating
Modifying the value of an existing element within the list.
Direct assignment: Assign a new value to the element at a specific index.

4. Slicing

Extracting a portion of the list, creating a new sublist.
Syntax: list_name[start:end:step]
start (inclusive): The starting index (default: 0).
end (exclusive): The ending index (default: end of the list).
step (optional): The step size (default: 1).
