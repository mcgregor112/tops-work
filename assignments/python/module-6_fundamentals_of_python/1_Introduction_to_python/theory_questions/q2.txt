q - History and evolution of Python.

Answer - 

Python is an widely-used programming language and conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum. Inspired by the ABC programming language, Guido aimed to create a language that was both powerful and easy to learn. The first version of Python, 0.9.0, was released in 1991.

Evolution :

Python 1.0 (1994): This version introduced significant features like functional programming tools like lambda, map, filter, and reduce.

Python 2.0 (2000): This major release brought in list comprehensions, garbage collection, and improved Unicode support.   

Python 3.0 (2008): A significant revision, Python 3.0 aimed to rectify fundamental flaws in the language. While it introduced many improvements, it was not entirely backward-compatible with Python 2.   

Python 3.x (Ongoing): Subsequent releases of Python 3 have focused on refining the language, enhancing performance, and adding new features like type hints, asynchronous programming, and more.
