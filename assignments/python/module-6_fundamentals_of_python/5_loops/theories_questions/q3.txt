q - Using loops with collections (lists, tuples, etc.).

Answer :

For loops are the most common way to iterate over collections in Python. They're particularly useful for processing each element in a sequence.

list_name = ['apple' , 'banana' , 'cherry']

syntax for lists :

for var in list_name:
    print(var)

tuple_name = ('apple' , 'banana' , 'cherry')

syntax for tuple:

for var in tuple_name:
    print(var)
