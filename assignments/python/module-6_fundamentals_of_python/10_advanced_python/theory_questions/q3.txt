q - Introduction to closures and decorators.

Answer :

closures : A closure is a function object that has access to variables from its enclosing lexical scope, even after the scope in which the closure was created has finished executing.

decorators : A decorator is a design pattern that allows you to modify or enhance the behavior of functions or methods without changing their actual code.
