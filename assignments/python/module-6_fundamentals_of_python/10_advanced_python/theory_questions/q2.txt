q - Using map(), reduce(), and filter() functions for processing data.

Answer :

map() :

The map() function applies a given function to each item in an iterable (like a list) and returns an iterable of the results. It's great for transforming data.

reduce() :

The reduce() function from the functools module applies a binary function (a function that takes two arguments) cumulatively to the items of an iterable, reducing the iterable to a single value.

filter() :

The filter() function filters elements of an iterable based on a condition defined in a function. It only includes elements for which the function returns True.
