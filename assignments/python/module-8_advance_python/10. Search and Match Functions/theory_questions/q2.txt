q - Difference between search and match.

Answer -

re.search() :

The re.search() function is used to find a substring within a string and returns a match object if found. It is useful when searching for patterns in a larger text.

re.match() :

The re.match() function checks if a string starts with a specific pattern. If the pattern is found at the beginning of the string, it returns a match object; otherwise, it returns None.
