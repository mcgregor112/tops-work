q - Opening files in different modes ('r', 'w', 'a', 'r+', 'w+').

Answer - 

'r' (read mode) opens a file for reading (default mode).

'w' (write mode) creates a new file or overwrites an existing one.

'a' (append mode) adds new content without deleting existing data.

'r+' (read and write mode) allows reading and writing without truncating the file.

'w+' (write and read mode) creates or overwrites a file and allows reading.
