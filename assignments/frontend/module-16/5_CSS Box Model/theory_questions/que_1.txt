q - Explain the CSS box model and its components (content, padding, border, margin). How does each affect the size of an element?

Answer - 

The CSS box model describes how every HTML element is structured and how its size is calculated. It consists of four components:

Content: The actual text or image inside the element.

Padding: The space between the content and the element’s border.

Border: A line that wraps around the padding and content.

Margin: The outermost space that separates the element from others.
