<!-- Task: o Create a JavaScript program to perform the following:
   Add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers using arithmetic operators. 
   Use comparison operators to check if two numbers are equal and if one number is greater than the other.
   Use logical operators to check if both conditions (e.g., a > 10 and b < 5) are true. -->
