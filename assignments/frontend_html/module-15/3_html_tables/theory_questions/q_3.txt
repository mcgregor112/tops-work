q - Why should tables be used sparingly for layout purposes? What is a better alternative?

Answer :

Tables should be used sparingly for layout because they were designed for structuring data, not presentation, and can negatively impact accessibility and flexibility. A better alternative is to use CSS layout techniques like Flexbox or Grid, which offer more control and flexibility for creating layouts.
