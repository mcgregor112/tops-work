<table>: This tag defines the overall table structure, acting as the container for all other table elements. 

<tr>: This tag defines a row within the table. 

<th>: This tag defines a header cell, typically used for column headings, and is usually rendered in bold. 

<td>: This tag defines a standard data cell within a table row. 

<thead>: This tag groups the header content of a table, which typically contains the <th> elements.
