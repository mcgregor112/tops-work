//callback function :A callback function in JavaScript is a function passed as an argument to another function, intended to be executed after the completion of a specific operation or at a later time. This mechanism is fundamental in JavaScript, especially for handling asynchronous operations and events. 
// Key characteristics and uses:
// Passed as an argument:
// The core concept is that a function (the callback) is provided to another function (the higher-order function) as one of its parameters.
// Executed later:
// The higher-order function is responsible for invoking the callback at the appropriate moment, which could be immediately (synchronously) or after an asynchronous task completes (asynchronously).
// Enabling asynchronous programming:
// Callbacks are crucial for handling operations that take time, such as fetching data from a server, reading files, or responding to user interactions (like clicks). They prevent the program from blocking while waiting for these tasks to finish, ensuring a responsive user experience.
// Event handling:
// Callbacks are widely used in event handling, where a function is executed when a particular event occurs (e.g., a button click, a key press).
// Error handling:
// Callbacks can be designed to receive error objects as arguments, allowing for robust error handling in asynchronous operations.
